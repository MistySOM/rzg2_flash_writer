The RZ/G2 flash writer is sample software for Renesas RZ/G2 Group MPUs.
The RZ/G2 flash writer downloads binary images from Host PC via SCIF or USB and writes those binary images to Serial NOR Flash or eMMC.

## 1. Overview

This document explains about the RZ/G2 flash writer sample software for Renesas RZ/G2 Group MPUs.

The RZ/G2 flash writer is downloaded from the Host PC via SCIF or USB by the boot ROM container within the RZ/G2 device.

The RZ/G2 flash writer downloads binary images from Host PC via SCIF or USB, and writes those binary  images to Serial NOR Flash (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Serial Flash&rdquo;) or eMMC.

The RZ/G2 flash writer's Serial Flash writing support is for on-board Serial NOR Flash devices (i.e. W25M512JW and others).

The RZ/G2 flash writer eMMC writing support is for High Speed SDR (i.e. 50MHz) and x8 bus width mode.

[Chapter 2](#2-operating-environment) describes the operating environment.

[Chapter 3](#3-software) describes the software.

[Chapter 4](#4-how-to-build-the-rzg2-flash-writer) explains example of how to build the RZ/G2 flash writer.

[Chapter 5](#5-how-to-run-the-rzg2-flash-writer) explains example of how to perform the RZ/G2 flash writer.

[Chapter 6](#6-error-case-to-handle) explains how to handle error case.

[Chapter 7](#7-revision-history) explains revision history.

*Note) This sample software does not support file systems. Therefore, only raw binary images can be downloaded and programmed into Serial NOR Flash or eMMC.*

make -f makefile.linaro clean
CROSS_COMPILE=~/gcc-linaro-7.3.1-2018.05-x86_64_aarch64-elf/bin/aarch64-elf- make -f makefile.linaro BOARD=HIHOPE
```

*Note) Makefile for linaro toolchain is changed from `makefile` to `makefile.linaro` at v1.01.*

Yocto SDK:

```shell
make clean
make BOARD=HIHOPE
```

Output image will be available in the following directory.

* ./AArch64_output/AArch64_Flash_writer_SCIF_DUMMY_CERT_E6300400_hihope.mot

The target file name changes depending on the build options.

The following table lists the relationship between build option and target files.

#### Description of build options and target files

| Build options | Target filename                                          |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| HIHOPE        | AArch64_Flash_writer_SCIF_DUMMY_CERT_E6300400_hihope.mot |
| EK874         | AArch64_Flash_writer_SCIF_DUMMY_CERT_E6300400_ek874.mot  |

## 5. How to run the RZ/G2 flash writer

### 5.1. Prepare for write to the Serial Flash and eMMC

Start the target in the SCIF download mode and run the RZ/G2 flash writer sample code.

Regarding the DIP switch configuration on the board, refer to [Related Document](#related-document) No.4.

The following table shows the setting of terminal software.

#### Terminal software configuration

| Baud rate  | Data bit length | Parity check | Stop bits | Flow control |
|-----------:|-----------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 115200bps  | 8bits           | none         | 1bit      | none         |

Terminal software outputs the following log at power ON the target.

```text
SCIF Download mode (w/o verification)
(C) Renesas Electronics Corp.

-- Load Program to SystemRAM ---------------
please send !
```

Transfer S-record file after the log output.

S-record file:

- AArch64_output/AArch64_Flash_writer_SCIF_DUMMY_CERT_E6300400_`<board_name>`.mot

After the transfer has succeeded, the following log will be shown.

```text
Flash writer for RZ/G2M V1.01 Jan.08,2020
>
```

Please enter the any key from the console to continue.

For details on how to write to the Serial Flash and eMMC, please refer to [Section 3.4](#34-command-specification).

### 5.2. Prepare for boot from the Serial Flash and eMMC

To boot from the eMMC, need to change the DIP switch setting.

Regarding the DIP switch configuration on the board, refer to [Related Document](#related-document) No.4.

## 6. Error case to handle

### 6.1. EXT_CSD incorrect setting case

If error of eMMC command is occurred, please check the following description and restart.

- Please Check the correct setting of EXT_CSD. If the wrong setting is present, to set the correct setting using EM_SECSD command.
- Program start address error of S-record file.

The following shows the setting of High speed SDR(50MHz) x8 bus width mode, Boot partition 1 enable.

| Address      | Register Name       | Filed name             | Bit filed | Settings |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|
| EXT_CSD[179] | PARTITION_CONFIG    | BOOT_ACK               | [6]       | 0x0      |
|              |                     | BOOT_PARTITION_ENABLE  | [5:3]     | 0x1      |
| EXT_CSD[177] | BOOT_BUS_CONDITIONS | BOOT_MODE              | [4:3]     | 0x1      |
|              |                     | BOOT_BUS_WIDTH         | [1:0]     | 0x2      |

For details of EXT_CSD, please refer to [Related Document](#related-document) No.1.

### 6.2. Program start address error of S-record format file

After the message "Please Input User Program Start Address" has been displayed, input a start address of the S-record format file to be loaded (smallest value) as the start address of the program. (This address is treated as the start address and branch address of the data transfer destination from the eMMC device in the program.)

Please check the program start address and write again program using EM_W command.
